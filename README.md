*"Ready? Set? Sing!"
The Reborn of funkin-utau
-------------------
A repository with the famous game Friday Night Funkin's characters voices, for UTAU!

Since i saw many people reuploading this AND uncrediting me in mods like Garcello Mod, Friday Night Shootin', etc. I decided to take funkin-utau repository down. Only because i saw people DM'ing me on Discord for the download and stuff, i was forced to put this up again.

You MUST credit GenoX and KawaiSprite when using!!, Also if you're using a FANMADE UTAU, credit the original autors of them!

IMPORTANT NOTES:
---------------------

Some VoiceBanks like Pico and Monster needs to be lowed 2 octaves so they can sound normal, for do that follow this guide:

>1 Go to the "Edit" menu (In UTAU, ofc)

>2 Select "Move Region by Number"

>3 The next you need to know about the piano roll, but you can put the number without knowing that. Expect getting it wrong) 

>4 If the notes of your midi/UST project are between C3 and C4, put -24 on the box, but if the notes are between C2 and C3, put -12

>5 Press OK

>The notes are now octaves lower! press play for see if Pico and Monster now sounds good!

With the same guide of before you can also do with male voices like Whitty
>Whitty uses 1 octave lower, so move -12

Skid and Pump have the same voice provideer but different between South and Spookeez
>so i put Spookez as Skid and South as Pump
